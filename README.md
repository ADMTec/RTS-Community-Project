Welcome to RTS Community Project
=====================

Hi there!

This is the project page for a **Real Time Strategy Game** developed by the awesome [Unreal Engine 4 community] (https://forums.unrealengine.com/). 
Started by Satheesh PV (aka ryanjon2040) on Aug-12-2014 this project is meant to be released on PC and possibly for Android and iOS. If you are a Unreal Engine 4 Subscriber then dont wait.
Jump right in and download this project.

This project is aimed to be Blueprint exclusive but this may change in future.

How to get started
-------------------

The current RTS Community project is based on Unreal Engine version 4.4.0 Preview Build.  You can always get this version of the engine using the [Unreal Engine Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard), or you can grab the [full engine source](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/tag/4.4.0-preview) from GitHub and compile it yourself.

**Downloading the RTS project:**

- Download the project by clicking the **Download Source** button on this page.
- Unzip the files to a folder on your computer.  
- Load up [Unreal Editor](https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard)
- On the Project Browser screen, click **Browse** and navigate to the folder where unzipped the files.
- Choose the **RTSTemplate.uproject** file.  

You'll now be looking at the very latest work-in-progress version of the game!
